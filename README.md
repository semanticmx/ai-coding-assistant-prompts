### PRD Prompt Template

**File:** `prd-prompt-template.md`

A comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) template designed to be platform-agnostic. This template helps structure PRDs for any technology stack or architecture pattern.

**Sections included:**
1. **High-Level Overview and Context** - Product purpose, business context, and strategic alignment
2. **Requirements and Functionality** - Purpose, objectives, functional/non-functional requirements, and user flows
3. **Design and User Experience** - Core components, admin tools, UI/UX guidelines, and communication flows
4. **Planning and Execution** - Authentication, technical stack, architecture, security, CI/CD, scalability, and cost optimization
5. **Supporting Information** - Constraints, risks, assumptions, dependencies, and success metrics

This template uses platform-neutral terminology (e.g., "presentation layer" instead of "front-end", "architecture pattern" instead of "serverless") making it suitable for any project type.
